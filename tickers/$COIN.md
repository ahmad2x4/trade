It seems Coinbase is has formed a cup and making the handle over the course of last 15 weeks. It worth keepint an eye to see if it breaks out. Before any action should run through CANSLIM checklist

Although now I am looking at it something is wrong. Usually cup and handle is for market correction and shakeout. However it is too soon for $COIN to have market correction and shake out.
